    <h1>Google fonts Activity </h1>
    <p>
        The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element (the value must be unique within the HTML document). The id value
        can be used by CSS and JavaScript to perform certain tasks for a unique element with the specified id value. In CSS,
        to select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element: Example Use
        CSS to style an element with the id "myHeader": About The Lobster font took a different approach. The new OpenType
        format gives us the possibility to have multiple versions of each letter, and that's exactly what we are doing: Instead
        of compromising the design of our letters to force connections, we do what lettering artist do. We draw many versions
        of each letter and a lot of different letter-pairs (aka "ligatures") so we always use the best possible variation
        of each letter depending of the context of the letter inside each word. All this happens automatically in any browser
        that supports ligatures.
